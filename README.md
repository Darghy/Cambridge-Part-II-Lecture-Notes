# Cambridge Part II Lecture Notes

These are my personal lecture notes from Michaelmas Term 2022 for Galois Theory, Graph Theory, Number Theory, and the non-examinable Part III Analytic Number Theory course. The LaTeX files are also available.

[Galois Theory](https://github.com/Darghy/Cambridge-Part-II-Lecture-Notes/blob/main/II%20Galois%20Theory/Galois_Theory.pdf), [tex file](https://github.com/Darghy/Cambridge-Part-II-Lecture-Notes/blob/main/II%20Galois%20Theory/Galois_Theory.tex)

[Graph Theory](https://github.com/Darghy/Cambridge-Part-II-Lecture-Notes/blob/main/II%20Graph%20Theory/Graph_Theory.pdf), [tex file](https://github.com/Darghy/Cambridge-Part-II-Lecture-Notes/blob/main/II%20Graph%20Theory/Graph_Theory.tex)

[Number Theory](https://github.com/Darghy/Cambridge-Part-II-Lecture-Notes/blob/main/II%N20umber%20Theory/Number_Theory.pdf), [tex file](https://github.com/Darghy/Cambridge-Part-II-Lecture-Notes/blob/main/II%20Number%20Theory/Number_Theory.tex)

[Analytic Number Theory](https://github.com/Darghy/Cambridge-Part-II-Lecture-Notes/blob/main/III%20Analytic%20Number%20Theory/ANT.pdf), [tex file](https://github.com/Darghy/Cambridge-Part-II-Lecture-Notes/blob/main/III%20Analytic%20Number%20Theory/ANT.tex) (these notes are less well-written than the other ones)

As per usual with these kinds of documents, assume all errors are made by me and not the lecturers. Feel free to modify/use these files for your own purposes (and if you feel up for it, message me if you do so - it'd make me happy to find out that these are useful for someone).

## How do I take notes in LaTeX?

I use LaTeX in VSCode on Windows. I am able type notes live due to my extensive usage of the [hypersnips](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=draivin.hsnips) engine.
