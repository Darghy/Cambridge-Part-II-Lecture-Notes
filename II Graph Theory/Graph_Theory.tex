\section{Introduction}
\marginpar{07 Oct 2022, Lecture 1}


\textbf{Notation.} We write $[n]$ for $\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$. For a set $X$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$, define $X^{(k)} = \{S \subset X ~|~ |S| = k\}$, i.e. the set of all subsets of size $k$.

\section{Fundamentals}

\begin{defn}
    A \textbf{graph} is an object $G = (V, E)$ where $V$ is a set and ${E \subseteq V^{(2)}}$.
\end{defn}

$V$ is the set of vertices, and $E$ is the set of edges.

$V(G)$ will denote $V$, $E(G)$ will denote $E$, and we define $|G| = |V(G)|$ (sometimes called the order) and $e(G)=|E(G)|$ (sometimes called the size).

\begin{example}
    The \textbf{complete graph} on $n$ vertices is denoted $K_n$. This is the graph where $V(K_n) = [n]$ and $E(K_n) = [n]^{(2)}$.
\end{example}

\textbf{Remark.} We assume the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We don't order edges;
    \item We don't allow loops (an edge joining a vertex to itself);
    \item We don't allow multiple edges;
    \item Most of the time, $V(G)$ will be finite (we will explicitly say when it's not).
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}
    The \textbf{empty graph} on $n$ vertices, denoted $\overline{K_n}$, has $V(\overline{K_n}) = [n]$ and $E(\overline{K_n})= \emptyset$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    The path of length $n$, denoted $P_n$, is a path: it has $V(P_n) = [n+1]$ and $E(P_n) = \{\{i, i+1\} ~|~ 1\le i\le n\}$.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    The cycle of length $n$, denoted $C_n$, has $V(C_n) = [n]$ and $E(C_n) = \{\{i, i+1\} ~|~ 1\le i \le n-1\} \cup \{\{1,n\}\}$.
\end{example}

Let $G$ be a graph and $x \in V(G)$. The \textbf{neighborhood} of $x$ is $N(x) = \{y ~|~ xy \in E(G)\}$, i.e. all the vertices connected to $x$. If $y \in N(x)$, we write $x \sim y$ and say $y$ is a \textbf{neighbor} of $x$ or that $y$ is \textbf{adjacent} to $x$.

\vspace{1mm}

The \textbf{degree} of $x$ is $\text{deg}(x) = |N(x)|$.

Just as a formality, we define graph isomorphism: let $G, H$ be graphs. A graph isomorphism is a bijection $\phi : V(G) \to V(H)$ such that it maps edges to edges, i.e. $uv \in E(G) \iff \phi(u)\phi(v) \in E(H)$.

\begin{defn}[Subgraph]
    We say $H$ is a \textbf{subgraph} of $G$ if $V(H) \subseteq V(G)$ and $E(H) \subseteq E(G)$.
\end{defn}

Two subgraph types that are important enough to have their own notation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item If $G$ is a graph, and $xy \in E(G)$, define $G - xy$ to be the graph $(V(G), E(G) \setminus \{xy\})$.
    \item For $x,y \in V(G)$, define $G+xy$ to be the graph $(V(G), E(G) \cup \{xy\})$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{defn}[Path]
    Let $G$ be a graph, $x,y \in V(G)$. A \textbf{$x-y$ path in $G$} is a sequence $x_1, \ldots, x_k$ where $x_1 = x, ~x_k = y$ and $x_ix_{i+1} \in E(G) ~\forall 1\le i \le k-1$ and all the $x_i$ are distinct.     
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    A graph is \textbf{connected} if $~\forall x \neq y \in V(G)$, there exists an $x-y$ path in $G$.
\end{defn}

\textbf{Remark.} A little annoyingly, if $P$ is a $x-y$ path and $P'$ is a $y-z$ path, then the concatenation $PP'$ may not be a path (since the vertices of the new path might not be unique).

So let an $x-y$ \textbf{walk} in a graph $G$ be a sequence $x_1,\ldots, x_k$ where ${x_1 = x}$, $x_k = y$ and $x_ix_{i+1} \in E(G) ~\forall 1\le i\le k-1$. Then a concatenation of walks is again a walk.

\vspace{1mm}

\begin{prop}
    If $W$ is an $xy$ walk, then $W$ contains a $xy$ path.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let $W' \subseteq W$ be a minimal $xy$ walk. We claim this is a path. If not, then some vertex $x_i$ must be visited at least twice, say $W' = x_1x_2\ldots x_i \ldots x_i x_l \ldots x_k$. Then take $W'' = x_1x_2\ldots x_i x_l \ldots x_k$. This contradicts the minimality of $W'$, so we're done.
\end{proof}

\marginpar{10 Oct 2022, Lecture 2}

\textbf{Remark.} We may define a \textbf{distance} on $V(G)$: for $x,y \in V(G)$, let $d(x,y)$ be the length of the shortest $xy$ path. If $G$ is connected, then this distance defines a metric on $V(G)$. 

\subsection{Trees}
\begin{defn}
    A graph $G$ is \textbf{acyclic} if it does not contain a cycle as a subgraph.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
    A graph $G$ is a \textbf{tree} if it is acyclic and connected.
\end{defn}
\begin{prop}
    The following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $G$ is a tree;
        \item $G$ is minimally connected ($~\forall xy \in E(G)$, $G-xy$ is not connected);
        \item $G$ is maximally acyclic ($~\forall  xy \not\in E(G)$, $G+xy$ contains a cycle).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    (a) $\implies $(b): A tree is connected. Assume for contradiction that $\exists  xy \in E(G)$ such that $G - xy$ is connected. Let $P$ be a $xy$ path in $G-xy$. But then $P$ defines a cycle in $G$, contradiction.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    (b) $\implies $(a): Minimally connected implies connected. For acyclicness, assume for contradiction that $G$ contains a cycle $C$. Let $xy \in E(C)$. We claim that $G-xy$ is connected. Choose $u \neq v \in V(G-xy)$. Let $P$ be a $uv$ path in $G$. If $P$ does not contain $xy$, we're done. If $P$ does contain $xy$, then take paths $u \to x$; $x \to y$ along our cycle without using $xy$; $y \to v$. The concatenation of these gives a $uv$ walk, which contains a $uv$ path. Hence $G-xy$ is connected, contradiction.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    (a) $\implies $(c): A tree is acyclic. Let $xy \not\in E(G), x\neq y$. Let $P$ be a $xy$ path. Then $P$ defines a cycle in $G+xy$.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    (c) $\implies $(a): We have acyclicity. If $G$ is not connected, $\exists x \neq y \in V(G)$ with no $xy$ path. Then $G+xy$ is acyclic.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
    If $T$ is a tree and $v \in V(T)$ with $\text{deg}(v) = 1$, we call $v$ a \textbf{leaf}.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
    Let $G$ be a graph and $X \subseteq V(G)$. Then $$G[X] = (X, E(G) \cap \{(u,v)~|~ u,v \in X\}).$$ We call this \textbf{the graph induced on $X$}. 
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
    If $x \in V(G)$, define $G-x = G[V(G) \setminus \{x\}]$.
\end{defn}
\begin{prop}
    Let $T$ be a tree, $|T|\ge 2$. Then $T$ has a leaf.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    Let $P = x_1\ldots x_k$ be the a longest possible path in $T$. Note $N(x_k) \subseteq \{x_1,\ldots,x_{k-1}\}$. If $x_i \sim x_k$ for some $1\le i\le k-2$, there is a cycle in $T$, contradiction. Thus $N(x_k) = \{x_{k-1}\} \implies X_k$ is a leaf.
\end{proof}
\textbf{Remark.} We can show that any $T$ has two leaves, but we can't do any better (consider a path).

\textbf{Remark.} We could have also proved this by taking a non-backtracking walk in $G$ (i.e. go out of a different edge then you came in on). Either we return (hence have a cycle) or get stuck (hence have a leaf).

\begin{prop}
    Let $T$ be a tree on $n\ge 1$ vertices. Then $e(G) = n-1$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    By induction. $n=1$ is trivial. Assume the claim holds for $n$. Take a tree $T$ with $n+1$ vertices. Let $x \in V(T)$ be a leaf. Then $T-x$ is connected and acyclic, therefore a tree, thus $e(T-x) = n-1$. But $e(G) = e(G-x)+1$ and $|V(G)| = |V(G-x)|+1$, hence we're done. 
\end{proof}
\begin{defn}
    Let $G$ be a connected graph. Then a subgraph $T$ of $G$ is a \textbf{spanning tree} if $T$ is a tree on $V(G)$.
\end{defn}
\begin{prop}
    Every connected graph contains a spanning tree.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    Start with the graph $G$, then throw away edges of $E(G)$ one by one subject to keeping the graph connected. At some point, the removal of any further edge will disconnect the graph, at which point we have a minimal connected subgraph of $G$, which by Prop. 1.2 is a tree.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Bipartite graphs}

\begin{defn}
    Let $G = (V,E)$ be a graph. $G$ is \textbf{bipartite} if there exists a partition $V = A \cup B$ such that $E(G) \subseteq \{uv ~|~ u \in A, v \in B\}$.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
    The \textbf{complete bipartite graph} $K_{n,m}$ is the graph with vertex set $A \cup B$, $A = \{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}, B = \{y_1,\ldots,y_m\}$ and edge set $E(K_{n,m}) = \{x_iy_j ~|~ x_i \in A, y_j \in B\}$.
\end{defn}

\textbf{Remark.} There obviously exist non-bipartite graphs: odd cycles are not bipartite.

\begin{defn}
    A \textbf{circuit} is a sequence $x_1,x_2,\ldots x_l x_{l+1}$, where $x_ix_{i+1} \in E(G)$ and $x_{l+1}=x_1$. The length of this circuit is $l$. We say a circuit is \textbf{odd} if its length is odd.
\end{defn}
\begin{prop}
    Let $C$ be an odd circuit in a graph $G$. Then $C$ contains an odd cycle.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    Let $x_1 x_2 \ldots x_i x_{i+1} \ldots x_i x_k \ldots x_lx_1$ be an odd circuit. Consider the circuits $C_1 = x_1\ldots x_i x_k \ldots x_l x_1$ and $C_2 = x_i x_{i+1} \ldots x_{k-2} x_i$. Then one of $C_1, C_2$ has odd length and is strictly shorter, so we're done by induction.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $G$ be a graph. Then \[
    G \text{ is bipartite} \iff G \text{ does not contain an odd cycle}.
    \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    $(\implies )$: If $G$ contains an odd cycle, then as odd cycles are not bipartite, $G$ cannot be bipartite.

    $(\impliedby)$: We may assume that $G$ is connected. Let us fix $x_0 \in V(G)$. Let 
    \begin{align*}
        &V_0 = \{x \in V(G) ~|~ d(x,x_0) \equiv 0 \pmod{2}\}\\ 
        &V_1 = \{x \in V(G) ~|~ d(x,x_0) \equiv 1 \pmod{2}\}.
    \end{align*}
    We claim this is a bipartition of $G$. Assume for contradiction that $\exists u,v \in V_0$ s.t. $uv \in E(G)$. But there is an even $ux_0$ path and and an even $vx_0$ path, thus putting these three paths together gives an odd circuit in $G$. By Prop 1.6, $G$ contains an odd cycle, contradiction. (Analogous proof for $V_1$).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Planar graphs}

\begin{defn}
    A \textbf{planar graph} is a graph that can be drawn in the plane with no edge crossings.
\end{defn}
\begin{example}
    $K_4$ is planar. A path $P_n$ is planar.
\end{example}
\begin{defn}
    A \textbf{plane graph} is one such drawing of a graph in the plane without edge crossings.
\end{defn}
Note that this is important, since we can draw $K_4$ in a way that it does have edges crossing.
\begin{example}
    $K_{2,3}$ is planar. $K_{3,3}$ is not planar. $K_5$ is not planar (we don't prove this right now).
\end{example}

\textbf{Question.} What graphs are planar? Is there a (simple) method to decide if a graph is planar?

\begin{defn}
    Let $G$ be a plane graph. Consider $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus G$. This is broken into finitely many regions. These are called the \textbf{faces} of the plane graph.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
    The \textbf{boundary} of a face $F$ is the collection of vertices and edges on the topological boundary.
\end{defn}
\textbf{Remark.} The boundary of a face need not be a cycle. It need also not be connected. In fact, the boundary need not contain a cycle at all (consider a tree). 

\textbf{Remark.} We also note that two different drawings of a graph in the plane can be fundamentally different. 

\begin{theorem}[Euler]
    Let $G$ be a connected plane graph with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges and $f$ faces. Then $n-m+f = 2$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We induct on $m$. $m=1$ is clear. If $G$ is acyclic, then $G$ is a tree, so $m=n-1$, $f=1$ and we're done.
    
    So assume $G$ contains a cycle and let $e$ be an edge on this cycle. Delete $e$. Then $n$ stays fixed, $m$ decreases by $1$, and $f$ decreases by 1, so by induction, $n- (m-1) + (f-1) = 2$ and we're done.
\end{proof}
\textbf{Remark.} We really do need the graph to be connected, consider $t$ triangles in the plane as a counterexample.

\begin{cor}
    Let $G$ be a planar graph, $|G| \ge 3$. Then $e(G) \le 3|G| - 6$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
    Draw $G$ in the plane. We may assume that $G$ is connected. Let $F$ be a face, let $\text{deg}(F) =$ the number of edges in $G$ that touch $F$. Note $\text{deg}(F) \ge 3$. Now note that since every edge touches at most two faces, we get $$3f \le \sum_{F \text{ a face}}^{} \text{deg}(F) \le 2 e(G) \implies f\le \frac{2}{3}e(G).$$
    Put this into Euler's formula to get $$n - \frac{1}{3}e(G) \ge n - e(G) + f =2 \implies 3(n-2) \ge e(G).$$
\end{proof}
\textbf{Remarks.} (i): This is a statement about planar graphs only.

(ii): This is quite restrictive. $K_n$ has ${{n} \choose {2}} \approx n^2/2$ edges, while our above corollary says the number of edges of a planar graph is linear in $n$.

\begin{cor}
    $K_5$ is not planar.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
    We have $e(K_5)=10, n=5$, so $10 e(G) \not \le 3|G|-6 = 9$, so we're done by the above corollary.
\end{proof}
But $K_{3,3}$ does not fail this test. So we need to improve our argument:
\begin{cor}
    Let $G$ be a planar graph, $|G|\ge 4$ and $G$ has no cycles of length $3$. Then $e(G) \le 2|G| - 4$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
    Repeat the proof of Corollary 1.9, but use $\text{deg}(F) \ge 4$ for every face.
\end{proof}
Now we can see that $K_{3,3}$ is not planar. $K_{3,3}$ has no cycle of length 3 by definition, $n=6$, $e(G)=9$, so $9 = e(G) \not \le 2\cdot (6-2) = 8$.

\marginpar{14 Oct 2022, Lecture 4}

\begin{defn}
    A \textbf{subdivision}  of a graph $G$ is a subgraph where we replace some of the edges of $G$ with disjoint paths.
\end{defn}
\textbf{Observation.} A subdivision of a \textbf{non-planar}  graph is non-planar.

\textbf{Observation.} If $G$ contains a $K_{3,3}$ or $K_5$ subdivision as a subgraph, then $G$ is non-planar.

\begin{theorem}[Kuratowski's theorem]
    $G$ is planar $\iff$ $G$ does not contain a subdivided $K_{3,3}$ or $K_5$. 
\end{theorem}

We do not prove this, but the proof is actually not too hard.

\newpage
\section{Connectivity \& matching}

\subsection{Matching in bipartite graphs}

Let $G = (X \sqcup Y, E)$ be bipartite with bipartition $X,Y$.
\begin{defn}
    A \textbf{matching from $X$ to $Y$} is a set of edges $\{xy_x ~|~ x \in X, y_x \in Y\}$ and $x \to y_x$ is an injection. 
\end{defn}

\textbf{Question.} When does a bipartite graph have a $X$ to $Y$ matching?

We can first think about examples where we do not have a matching. For example, we clearly have no matching if $|X| > |Y|$. 
\begin{defn}
    Let $G$ be a graph, $A \subseteq V(G)$. Define $N_G(A) = \bigcup_{x \in A} N(x)$.
\end{defn}
Then we clearly also don't have a matching if we have $A \subset X$ such that $|N(A)| < |A|$. But this is actually the only obstruction:

\begin{theorem}[Hall's Marriage Theorem]
    Let $G$ be a bipartite graph $G = (X \sqcup Y, E)$. Then
    \[
    G \text{ has a matching from }X \text{ to }Y \iff ~\forall A \subseteq X, ~|N(A)|\ge A.
    \]
    The right-hand side is called Hall's criterion.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    $(\implies)$ is the easy direction.

    Now let $M$ be a matching and let $A \subseteq X$. Then if $\{y_1,\ldots,y_{|A|}\}$ are matched to $A$, we show $|N(A)| \ge  |\{y_1,\ldots,y_{|A|}\}| \ge |A|$.

    $(\impliedby)$: Apply induction on $|X|$. If $|X|=1$, we're done. For the induction step, consider the following question: is there $\emptyset \neq A \subsetneq X$ such that $|N(A)|=|A|$? 
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    If the answer is no, then $~\forall A \subsetneq X$ we have $|N(A)| \ge |A| + 1$. Let $xy \in E(G)$ and let $G' = G[X\setminus \{x\} \cup Y\setminus \{y\}]$. We now check Hall's criterion for $G'$. If $B \subseteq X\setminus \{x\}$, then $|N_{G'}(B)| \ge |N_G(B)|-1 \ge |B|$, so done by induction.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    If the answer is yes, then let $G_1 = G[A \cup N(A)]$ and $G_2 = G[X\setminus A \cup Y\setminus N(A)]$. 
    
    Claim 1: $G_1$ satisfies Hall's criterion. Let $B \subseteq A$, then $$|N_{G_1}(B)| = |N_G(B)| \ge B.$$

    Claim 2: $G_2$ satisfies Hall's criterion. Let $B \subset X\setminus A.$ Consider $N_G(A \cup B)$. One the one hand, $|N_G(A \cup B)| \ge |A| + |B|$. On the other hand, $|N_G(A)| + |N_{G_2}(B)| = |N_G(A \cup B)|$. As $|N(A)|=|A|$, we get $|N_{G_2}(B)| \ge |B|$.

    From claims 1 and 2 we can apply induction in $G_1,G_2$ to get a matching in these graphs, and then put them together to get a matching in $G$.
\end{proof}
\begin{defn}
    A matching of deficiency of $d$ from $X$ to $Y$ is a matching from $X'$ to $Y$ where $X' \subseteq X$, $|X|-d = |X'|$.
\end{defn}
\begin{theorem}[Defect Hall's Theorem]
    \[
    G \text{ contains a matching of deficiency }d \iff ~\forall A \subseteq X,~ |N(A)| \ge |A| - d.
    \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    $(\implies ):$ easy.
    
    $(\impliedby):$ Add $d$ phantom vertices to $Y$, which we join to all vertices in $X$, so we now satisfy Hall's condition. Apply Hall to get a matching, and then remove the $d$ vertices we added, which removes at most $d$ elements of $X$.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
    Let $G$ be a graph. The \textbf{minimum degree} in $G$ is $\delta(G) = \min_{x \in V(G)} d(x)$, and the \textbf{maximal degree} in $G$ is $\Delta(G) = \max_{x \in V(G)} d(x)$. 
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
    A graph is \textbf{regular} if $\delta(G)=\Delta(G)$. It is \textbf{k-regular} if $k=\delta(G)=\Delta(G)$.
\end{defn}

\marginpar{17 Oct 2022, Lecture 5}

\begin{cor}
    For $k\ge 1$, if $G=(X \sqcup Y, E)$ is a $k$-regular bipartite graph, then there exists a matching from $X$ to $Y$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
    We check Hall's criterion. Let $A \subseteq X$. On the one hand, $$e(G[A \cup N(A)]) = \sum_{v \in A}^{} \text{deg}(v) = k|A|.$$ On the other hand, $$e(G[A \cup N(A)]) \le  \sum_{v \in N(A)}^{} \text{deg}(v) \le k|N(A)|.$$
    Hence $|N(A)|\ge |A|$ and we're done.
\end{proof}

Let $\Gamma$ be a finite group and let $H$ be a subgroup of $\Gamma$. Let $L_1,\ldots,L_n$ be the set of left cosets and $R_1,\ldots,R_n$ be the right cosets (of the forms $gH$ and $Hg$ respectively).

\textbf{Question.} Is there $g_1,\ldots,g_n \in \Gamma$ such that $g_1H,\ldots,g_nH$ are the left cosets and $Hg_1,\ldots, Hg_n$ are the right cosets?
\begin{cor}
    There exist $g_1,\ldots,g_n \in \Gamma \ge H$ such that $g_1H,\ldots,g_nH$ are the left cosets and $Hg_1,\ldots,Hg_n$ are the right cosets.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
    It is enough to find a pairing $L_i \leftrightarrow R_{\sigma(i)}$ such that $L_i \cap R_{\sigma(i)} \neq \emptyset ~\forall i$. Then choose $g_i \in L_i \cap R_{\sigma(i)}$ and we have $g_i H =L_i$, $Hg_i = R_{\sigma(i)}$.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    Define $X = \{R_1,\ldots,R_n\}$ and $Y=\{L_1,\ldots, L_n\}$, and define $R_i \sim L_j$ when $R_i \cap L_j \neq \emptyset ~\forall i,j$. Let $A = \{r_{i_1},\ldots,R_{i_k}\}$. Note
    \[
    \left|\bigcup_{j=1}^k R_{i_j}\right| = k|H|.
    \] 
    But $L_1,\ldots,L_n$ partition $\Gamma$ and $|L_i|=|H|$, so at least $k$ left cosets must intersect $\bigcup R_{i_j}$. Thus Hall's criterion is satisfied and we're done.

\subsection{Connectivity}

For a tree, $G-x$ (where $x$ is any non-leaf) is disconnected. On the other hand, remove any 2 vertices from the Petersen graph and it stays connected (but if you remove any 3, you disconnect it).
\vspace{1mm}

\textbf{Notation.} Let $S \subseteq V(G)$, and let $G - S = G[V(G) \setminus S]$.

\begin{defn}
    Let $G$ be a graph, $|G|\ge 1$. Define $$\kappa(G) = \min \{|S| ~|~ \exists S \subseteq V(G), G-S \text{ is disconnected or a single vertex}\}.$$
    We say a graph $G$ is \textbf{$k$-connected}  if $\kappa(G) \ge k$.
\end{defn}

In other words, $G$ is $k$-connected if and only if $G-S$ is connected for all $ S \subseteq V(G), |S|\le k-1$.

\begin{example}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\kappa(\text{Tree})=1$.
        \item $\kappa(\text{Petersen graph}) = 3$, so we can say the Petersen graph is 3-connected.
        \item $\kappa(\text{Cycle}) = 2$.
        \item $\kappa(K_n) = n-1$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}

We have another natural definition of connectivity.

\begin{defn}
    Let $G$ be a graph and let $a,b \in V(G)$. Say that $ab$ paths $P_1,\ldots,P_k$ are \textbf{disjoint} if $V(P_i) \cap V(P_j) = \{a,b\} ~\forall i \neq j$.
\end{defn}

Amazingly, we have Menger's theorem: These two notions of connectivity (\# of disjoint paths and $\kappa(G)$) are equivalent.
\vspace{1mm}

\textbf{Remarks:} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item We have $\delta(G)\ge \kappa(G)$. To see this, delete $N(x)$ for $x \in V(G) $ of minimal degree, then $G-N(x)$ is disconnected (or a single vertex).
    \item We have $\kappa(G-x) \ge \kappa(G) - 1$. This is clear: if $S \subset V(G-x)$ disconnects $G-x$ with $|S|\le \kappa(G)-2$, then $S \cup \{x\}$ disconnects $G$, contradiction.
    \item We can have $\kappa(G-x) > \kappa(G)$. For example, a cycle is 2-connected, but a cycle with one protruding edge is 1-connected.
\end{itemize}


\begin{defn}
    A \textbf{component} in $G$ is a maximal connected subgraph.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
    Let $G$ be a graph, let $a,b \in V(G), a\neq b, a \not\sim b$. Say $S \subseteq V(G) \setminus \{a,b\}$is a $a-b$ \textbf{separator} if $G-S$ disconnects $a$ from $b$ (i.e. $a,b$ are in different components of $G-S$).
\end{defn}
\begin{theorem}[Menger's theorem, form 1]
    Let $G$ be a connected graph and fix $a,b \in V(G), a\neq b, a \not\sim b$. Then the minimum size of an $a-b$ separator is equal to the maximal number of disjoint paths from $a$ to $b$.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    In other words, if all $a-b$ separators have size $\ge k$, then there exist $P_1,\ldots,P_k$, disjoint paths between $a$ and $b$.
\end{theorem}

\marginpar{19 Oct 2022, Lecture 6}

\textbf{Note.} Define $\kappa_{a,b}(G)$ be the size of the minimal $a-b$ separator.

\textbf{Note.} Recall $\kappa(G-x)\ge \kappa(G)-1$, and also $\kappa(G-xy)\ge \kappa(G)-1$. We also have $\kappa_{a,b}(G-x)\ge \kappa_{a,b}(G)-1$ and  $\kappa_{a,b}(G-xy)\ge \kappa_{a,b}(G)-1$ (exercise, not hard).

\begin{proof}
    Assume for contradiction that the statement of the theorem is false. Let $G$ be a minimal counterexample to the theorem that 
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item minimizes $k$;
        \item subject to (a), choose $G$ to minimize $e(G)$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Now let $S$ be a minimal $a,b$ separator in $G$. We have $|S|=k$. Note that the theorem is true for $k=1$, so assume $k\ge 2$.

    If $S \neq N(A)$ and $S\neq N(B)$, consider $G-S$ and let $A$ be the component containing $a$ and $B$ be the component containing $B$.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    Define $G_a = G[A \cup S]$ along with a vertex $c$ joined to each vertex in $S$, and $G_b = G[B \cup S]$ along with a vertex $c$ joined to each vertex in $S$. Note that $\kappa_{a,c}(G_a) \ge k$, since any $a-c$ separator in $G_a$ is a $a,b$ separator in $G$. Likewise, $\kappa_{b,c}(G_b)\ge k$.

    \vspace{1mm}
    
    Note that $e(G_a) < e(G), e(G_b) < e(G)$ since $ N(a) \not\subset S, N(b) \not\subset S$. So there exists a neighbor $x$ of $b$ in $B$ with $\text{deg}(x) \ge 2$, else we can remove $x$ and apply minimality. 
    
    So by minimality of $G$, we can find $k$ disjoint $a,c$ paths, say $P_1,\ldots,P_k$ in $G_a$, and likewise we can find $k$ $b,c$ paths $Q_1,\ldots,Q_k$ in $G_b$. We can put these paths together to get paths $P_1Q_{\sigma(1)},\ldots,P_kQ_{\sigma(k)}$, which are $k$ disjoint $a,b$ paths, contradiction, done.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    Let us now assume WLOG that $S=N(a)$. 
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    \textbf{Claim}: $N(a) \cap N(b) = \emptyset$.
    
    Indeed, if $\exists x \in N(a) \cap N(b)$, consider $G-x$. We have $\kappa_{a,b}(G-x)\ge k-1$. Thus, by minimality, we can find $k-1$ disjoint $ab$ paths in $G-x$, so all of these, plus $axb$, gives us $k$ disjoint $ab$ paths in $G$, contradiction.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    Let $ax_1\ldots x_l b$ be a shortest $ab$ path. Note that $l\ge 2$ and $x_2 \neq b$. Consider $G-x_1x_2$. We must have $\kappa_{a,b}(G-x_1x_2)\le k-1$ by minimality, so $\kappa_{a,b}(G-x_1x_2)=k-1$. So there is a $a,b$ separator $\tilde{S}$, $|\tilde{S}| = k-1$ in $G-x_1x_2$. We see that $\tilde{S} \cup \{x_1\}$ and $\tilde{S} \cup \{x_2\}$ are $a,b$ separators in $G$ of size at most $k$. Now either $\tilde{S} \cup \{x_1\} \neq N(a),N(b)$ or $\tilde{S} \cup \{x_2\} \neq N(a),N(b)$, so we're done.
\end{proof}
\begin{cor}[Menger's theorem, form 2]
    Let $G$ be a connected graph, $|G|\ge 2$. Then $G$ is $k$-connected $\iff$ $~\forall a,b \in V(G), a \neq b$, there exist $k$ disjoint $ab$ paths in $G$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
    $\impliedby$ is the easy direction. Say $G-S$ is disconnected and let $a,b$ be in different components of $G-S$. Note $a \not\sim b$. Then $\exists $ $k$ disjoint $a-b$ paths and $S$ must intersect each of these, so $|S| \ge k$.

    $\implies $. Let $a,b \in V(G), a\neq b$. If $a \not\sim b$, then just apply Menger form 1 and we're done. If $a \sim b$, then consider $G-ab$. We have $\kappa_{a,b}(G-ab)\ge k-1$, so apply Menger form 1 to get $k-1$ disjoint paths and add back $ab$ as a $k^{\text{th}}$ path.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Edge connectivity}

Let $G$ be a graph. Let $\lambda(G) = \min \{|W| ~|~ W \subseteq E(G), G-W \text{ is disconnected}\}$. We say that $G$ is \textbf{$k$-edge connected} if $\lambda(G) \ge k$. 

\marginpar{21 Oct 2022, Lecture 7}


\begin{example}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A cycle has $\kappa(C_n)=2, \lambda(C_n)=2$.
        \item A "bowtie graph" has $\kappa(G)=1, \lambda(G)=2$. We can generalize this and take two copies of $K_n$ which intersect in one vertex, then $\kappa(G)=1$ and $\lambda(G)=n-1$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}
\begin{defn}
    We say paths $P_1,\ldots,P_k$ are \textbf{edge disjoint} if $$E(P_i) \cap E(P_j) = \emptyset ~\forall i\neq j.$$
\end{defn}
\begin{theorem}[Menger, edge version]\label{2.7}
    Let $G$ be a connected graph and $a,b \in V(G), a \neq b$. Then, every $W \subseteq E(G)$ that separates $a$ from $b$ having size $\ge k \implies \exists k$ edge disjoint $a-b$ paths $P_1,\ldots,P_k$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{defn}
    Let $G$ be a graph. The \textbf{line graph} of $G$, denoted $L(G)$, is defined to be the graph 
    \begin{align*}
        V(L(G)) &= E(G); \\
        \text{If } e,f \in E(G), &\text{ then } e\sim f \text{ if they share a vertex.}
    \end{align*}
\end{defn}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Thorem \ref{2.7}]
    Given $G$, define a new graph $G'$ by taking the line graph of $G$ and adding a vertex $a'$, which we join to all edges incident to $a \in G$, and similarly adding a vertex $b'$, which we join to all edges incident to $b \in G$.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    Note that there is a $ab$ path in $G$ if and only if there is an $a'b'$ path in $G'$. Thus $W \subseteq V(G') \setminus \{a,b\}$ is a $a'b'$ separator if and only if $W \subseteq E(G)$ is an $ab$ separator. Hence $\kappa_{a,b}(G')\ge k$.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    Now apply Menger (form 1) to find $k$ disjoint $ab$ paths $P_1,\ldots,P_k$ in $G'$. These describe edge disjoint walks in $G$ from $a$ to $b$. Thus there are disjoint paths $\tilde{P_1} \subseteq P_1,\ldots,\tilde{P_k} \subseteq P_k$ and we're done.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Menger, edge version 2]
    Let $G$ be a connected graph. Then $\lambda(G)\ge k \iff ~\forall a,b \in V(G)$ with $a\neq b, \exists k$ edge disjoint $ab$ paths.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    $\impliedby$ is the easy direction. To separate any two vertices, say $a,b$, we must remove an edge from each of the $ab$ paths, so $\lambda(G)\ge k$.
    $\implies$ follows from Menger, edge version 1.
\end{proof}

\section{Graph coloring}
\begin{defn}
    We say that $c : V(G) \to \{1,\ldots,k\}$ is a \textbf{$k$-coloring} (or a proper $k$-coloring) if $c(x)\neq c(y) ~\forall x\sim y$. 
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
    The \textbf{chromatic number of $G$} is \[
    \chi(G) = \min \{k ~|~ \exists \text{ a }k\text{-coloring of }G\}.
    \]
\end{defn}
\begin{example}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A path has chromatic number 2. $\chi(P_n)=2$.
        \item For a cycle, $\chi(G) = \begin{cases}
            2 &\text{ if }n \text{ is even.}\\
            3 &\text{ if }n \text{ is odd.}
        \end{cases}$
        \item A tree has chromatic number 2 by induction.
        \item A complete graph has $\chi(K_n) = n$.
        \item A bipartite graph has $\chi(K_{m,n}) = 2$. In fact, a graph $G$ is bipartite if and only if $\chi(G)=2$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}
\begin{prop}
    Let $G$ be a graph. Then $\chi(G) \le \Delta(G) + 1$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    Let $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ be an ordering of $V(G)$. We color the $(x_i)$ one at a time in this order. When we come to vertex $x_i$, at most $\Delta$ colors have been used in $N(x_i)$, so there is a free color for $x_i$.
\end{proof}
\textbf{Remark.} This proposition is sharp (e.g. on $K_n$).

\textbf{Remark.} This is sometimes called a greedy coloring. But a greedy coloring may produce a coloring that is not optimal!

\subsection{Coloring planar graphs}
\textbf{Observation.} Let $G$ be a planar graph. Then $\delta(G)\le 5$.
\begin{proof}
    The average degree of $G$ is $$\frac{1}{n}\sum_{v \in V(G)}^{} \text{deg}(v) = \frac{2e(G)}{n} \le \frac{2(3n-6)}{n} = 6 - \frac{12}{n} < 6.$$
    But all degrees of vertices are integers, so the minimal degree is $\le 5$.
\end{proof}
\begin{prop}
    If $G$ is planar, then $\chi(G)\le 6$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    We induct. Base step: if $|G| \le 6$, then we're clearly done.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    Induction step: Given a graph $G$, let $x$ be a vertex with $\text{deg}(x)\le 5$. Apply induction to $G-x$, which gives a coloring of $G-x$ with 6 colors. But $x$ has degree $\le 5$, thus there is a free color to color $x$ with.
\end{proof}

\marginpar{24 Oct 2022, Lecture 8}

\begin{theorem}
    If $G$ is planar, then $\chi(G) \le 5$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We apply induction on $|G|$. If $|G|\le 5$, we're done.
    
    Now let $G$ be a planar graph  and $x \in V(G)$ with $\text{deg}(x)\le 5$. Apply induction to $G-x$. Let neighbor $x_i$ of $x$ have color $i$, ordered clockwise around $x$. 
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    Question: Can we get from $x_1$ to $x_3$ only walking along vertices colored $1$ and $3$?

    If no, let $C$ be the component of $G$ of vertices colored 1 or 3 that contains $x_1$, so $x_3 \not\in C$. "Swap" the colours 1 and 3 on $C$. This is a proper coloring of $G-x$, so we can color $x$ with color 1 and we're done.
    
    If yes, ask the same question for $x_2$ and $x_4$ - if the answer is no, swap colors on the 2--4 component containing $x_2$, and we can color $x$ with color 2.

    If the answer is again yes, then we get a contradiction to planarity since the 1--3 path and the 2--4 path have to intersect somewhere and we're done.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Four color theorem, non-examinable]
    If $G$ is planar, then $\chi(G)\le 4$.
\end{theorem}
To see this is equivalent to the map version, take the dual of our graph (place a vertex inside each face (and one for the infinite face) and connect two vertices by an edge if the two faces have any common boundary).
\vspace{1mm}

Kempe "proved" the four colour theorem in 1879, but his proof had a mistake. It was then proved in 1976 by reducing the problem to about 2000 configurations and checking them by computer.
\vspace{1mm}

Also, this is the best we can do, since $K_4$ is planar - there is no "three color theorem".

\subsection{Coloring graphs}

\begin{prop}\label{3.5}
    Let $G$ be connected and $\delta(G)<\Delta(G)$. Then $\chi(G)\le \Delta(G)$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    Let $x_n$ have $\text{deg}(x_n) < \Delta(G)$. Then choose $x_{n-1}$ to be adjacent to $x_n$, $x_{n-2}$ to be adjacent to one of $\{x_n,x_{n-1}\}$, etc. Since $G$ is connected, we eventually order everything and the ordering has the property that all vertices have less than $\Delta(G)$ edges going to vertices with smaller index, so color greedily and we're done.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Brooks]
    Let $G$ be a connected graph which is not an odd cycle or a complete graph. Then $\chi(G)\le \Delta(G)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Apply induction on $|G|$. The claim is clearly is true for $|G|\le 3$. 

    Note that we may assume that $\Delta\ge 3$ (where $\Delta=\Delta(G)$).
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    \textbf{Claim 1.} If $G$ is 3-connected, then we're done.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    Proof. Define an ordering of $G$ as in the proposition above. Let $x_n$ have $\text{deg}(x_n) = \Delta$ and choose $x_1,x_2 \in N(x_n)$ with $x_1 \neq x_2, x_1 \not\sim x_2$. This is possible, since $G$ is not $K_{\Delta+1}$.

    Now consider $G \setminus \{x_1,x_2\}$. We order this in the same way as above: connect $x_{n-1}$ to $x_n$, $x_{n-2}$ to $x_{n-1}$ or $x_n$, etc. Since $G\setminus \{x_1,x_2\}$ is connected, we eventually order every vertex. Hence we're done by coloring greedily.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    \textbf{Claim 2.} If $\kappa(G)=1$, we're done.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    Proof. Let $x$ be a cut vertex and let $C_1,\ldots,C_k$ be the components of $G-x$. By induction, we can color each $G[C_i \cup x]$. Then permute colors to have $x$ always be the same color, and put everything back together to get a coloring of $G$.

    \marginpar{26 Oct 2022, Lecture 9}
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    \textbf{Claim 3.} If $\kappa(G)=2$, we're done.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    Proof. Let $S \subset V(G)$, $S=\{x,y\}, x\neq y$ be our separator. Let $C_1,\ldots,C_k$ be the components of $G-S$ and let $G_i = G[C_i \cup S]+xy$ for each $i$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Case 1: $\delta(G_i)<\Delta(G) ~\forall i$. In this case we can always color $C_1,\ldots,C_k$ by Proposition \ref{3.5}. Note that in each of these colorings, $x,y$ have different colors, so we can permute colors in a way that $x,y$ always have the same color, and put everything back together to get a coloring of $G$.
        \item Case 2: $\delta(G_1)=\Delta(G)$ (wlog assume $i=1$). In this case, $k=2$ and $|N(x) \cap C_1| = \Delta-1$. Also, $|N(x) \cap C_2|=1$ and $|N(y) \cap C_2|=1$. Thus let $x', y' \in C_2$ be such that $x'\sim x, y'\sim y$. Now observe that $\tilde{S}=\{x,y'\}$ is not of this bad form, so we're done by Case 1.
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}
\subsection{Chromatic polynomials}
\begin{defn}
    For a graph $G$, define the \textbf{chromatic polynomial} of $G$ to be the function $P_G : \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \to \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ by $P_G(t) = $ the number of $t$--colorings of $G$.

    In particular, the minimal value of $t$ for which $P_G(t)>0$ is $t = \chi(G)$.
\end{defn}
\begin{example}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $P_{\overline{K_n}}(t)=t^n$.
        \item $P_{K_n}(t)=t(t-1)\ldots(t-(n-1))$.
        \item $P_{P_{n-1}}(t)=t(t-1)^{n-1}$.
        \item $P_T(t)=t(t-1)^{n-1}$ where $T$ is a tree with $n$ vertices (proof: take a leaf, induct).
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{defn}
    Let $G$ be a graph and $e \in E(G)$. Define $G/e$ to be the \textbf{contraction} of $G$ along $e$, which is the graph 
    \begin{align*}
        V(G/e) = V(G)\setminus \{x,y\} \cup \{xy\}, \\
        E(G) = E(G[V\setminus \{x,y\}]) \cup \{ez ~|~ x \sim z\} \cup \{ez ~|~ y \sim z\}.
    \end{align*}
    (In other words, you just "squish" the edge $e$ and its endpoints become a single vertex.)
\end{defn}
\begin{prop}
    Let $G$ be a graph. We have $P_G(t) = P_{G-e}(t) - P_{G/e}(t)$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    Let $e=xy$. A $t$--coloring of $G-e$ where $x,y$ get different colors corresponds exactly to a $t$--coloring of $G$. On the other hand, a $t$--coloring of $G-e$ where $x,y$ get the same color corresponds exactly to a $t$--coloring of $G/e$. 
\end{proof}
\begin{prop}
    For a graph $G$, $P_G$ is a polynomial.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    Apply induction on $e(G)$. For the base case $e(G)=0$, $P_{\overline{K_n}}(t)=t^n$.
    Induction step: For $e \in E(G)$, $P_G(t) = P_{G-e}(t) - P_{G/e}(t)$ is a polynomial (as it is the difference of two polynomials), so we're done by induction.
\end{proof}
\begin{prop}
    Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Then $$P_G(t)=t^n - m t^{n-1} + \ldots.$$
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    Induction on the number of edges. If $e(G)=0$, then we're done.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    Induction step: Let $e \in E(G)$ and apply the deletion-contraction relation,
    $P_G(t)=P_{G-e}(t)- P_{G/e}(t)$. By induction, the leading terms on the RHS are \[
    (t^n - (m-1)t^{n-1} + \ldots) - (t^{n-1} - e(G/e)t^{n-2} + \ldots) = t^n - mt^{n-1} + \ldots .
    \]
\end{proof}
\textbf{Remarks.} We're going to stop here, but chromatic polynomials have a lot of other properties. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Other coefficients of $P_G$ contain other information about $G$, e.g. $$P_G = t^n - mt^{n-1} + \left({{m}\choose{2}} - \text{the number of triangles in }G\right)t^{n-2} + \ldots.$$
    \item If $G$ is planar, then $P_G(2 + \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}) \neq 0$.
    \item The coefficients of $c_0,\ldots,c_n$ of $P_G(t)$ are log-concave, i.e. $c_i^2 \ge c_{i-1}c_{i+1}$. June Huh won a Fields medal for this in 2021.
\end{itemize}

\marginpar{28 Oct 2022, Lecture 10}

\subsection{Edge coloring}
\begin{defn}
    For a graph $G$, a $k$--edge coloring is a function $c : E(G) \to [k]$ such that $c(e)\neq c(f)$ whenever $e,f \in E(G)$ share an endpoint.

    Define the \textbf{edge-chromatic number} (sometimes called the \textbf{chromatic index}) to be $$\chi'(G) = \min\{k \mid \exists k\text{-edge coloring of }G\}.$$
\end{defn}
Note that an edge coloring of $G$ corresponds exactly to a vertex coloring of the line graph of $G$, and so $\chi'(G)=\chi(L(G))$.
\vspace{1mm}

\textbf{Remarks.} \begin{itemize}
    \item $\chi'(G) = \begin{cases}
        2 &\text{ if } n \text{ even.} \\
        3 &\text{ if } n \text{ odd.}
    \end{cases}$
    \item $\Delta(G) \le \chi'(G)$.
    \item We can have $\Delta(G) < \chi'(G)$. For example, $\chi'(\text{Petersen})=4$.
    \item $\chi'(G)\le 2 \Delta(G)-1$ by coloring greedily.
    \item $\chi$ and $\chi'$ can be very different. For example, $\chi'(K_{t,1})=t, \chi(K_{t,1})=2$.
\end{itemize}

We now prove Vizing's theorem. First, some setup:
\begin{defn}
    Given an edge-coloring $c : E(G) \to [k]$, define the \textbf{color classes} of $c$ to be \[
    C_i = \{e : c(e)=i\}.
    \]
\end{defn}
\textbf{Question.} What does $(V(G), C_i \cup C_j)$ look like? It is the union of disjoint paths, isolated vertices and even cycles.

We say the components of this graph are $\{i,j\}$--components.

\begin{defn}
    Let $y \in V(G), c \in [\Delta+1]$. We say that $c$ is \textbf{missing} at $y$ if none of the edges incident at $y$ have color $c$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{theorem}[Vizing's theorem]
    Let $G$ be a graph. Then $$\chi'(G) \in \{\Delta(G), \Delta(G)+1\}.$$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Induction on $e(G)$. If $e(G)=0$, we're done.

    Induction step: given $G$, $e(G)>0$, let $xv \in e(G)$. Apply induction to the graph $G-xv$ to get a $\Delta+1$ edge coloring. We want to extend this coloring to $G$.

    Note that there is a color missing at every vertex and let $c_0$ be the color missing at $x$. Define a sequence of $v_1,\ldots,v_k \in N(x)$ and corresponding colors $c_1,\ldots,c_k$ such that $c_i$ is missing at $v_i$ as follows:

    First set $v_1=v$ and let $c_1$ be any color missing at $v_1$. Now say we have defined $v_i$ and $c_i$. Define $v_{i+1}$ such that $xv_{i+1}$ is colored $c_i$. Continue this way until one of two things happens:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Case 1: Say we have defined $v_k,c_k$ and $c_k$ is missing at $x.$ Then recolor $xv_k$ with color $c_k$, so now $c_{k-1}$ is missing at $x$. Hence recolor $xv_{k-1}$ with color $c_{k-1}$, so now $c_{k-2}$ is missing at $x$, etc, until we color $xv_i$ with color $c_i$ for all $i\le k$. This includes $i=1$, so we're done.
        \item Case 2: Say $c_k=c_i$ for some $i<k$. Note that we may assume $i=1$ by recoloring as in Case 1 (i.e. uncolor $xv_{i}$ and color $xv_j \to c_j$ for all $j<i$). The question we ask is whether $v_1$ is in the same $\{c_0,c_1\}$--component as $x$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If not, swap colors on the $\{c_0,c_1\}$--component containing $v_1$. Then $c_0$ is missing at both $x$ and $v_1$, and so we can color $xv_1$ with $c_0$ and we're done.
            \item If yes, we need another question: Is $x$ in the same $\{c_0,c_1\}$--component as $v_k$?
            \begin{itemize}
                \item If the answer is no, then swap colors in the $\{c_0,c_1\}$--component containing $v_k$. So $c_0$ is missing at $v_k$ and $x$, so we are done by Case 1.
                \item If yes, then $x,v_1,v_k$ are all in the same $\{c_0,c_1\}$--component. But one of $c_0,c_1$ is missing at each of $x,v_1,v_k$. Thus $x,v_1,v_k$ all have to be endpoints of a path in the same $\{c_0,c_1\}$--component, which is a contradiction.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Coloring graphs on surfaces}

\marginpar{31 Oct 2022, Lecture 11}

If $G$ is planar, we know that$\chi(G) \le 5$. (And really $\chi(G)\le 4$). If $G$ is drawn on a surface $S$, can we say anything about $\chi(G)$?
\vspace{1mm}

$K_7$ can be drawn on a torus without edge crossings, so we definitely don't have a 4 color theorem for the torus:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{drawing1.pdf}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Question.} Is there a ''7 color theorem'' for the torus?

\begin{defn}
    We define the \textbf{surface of genus $g$} (more formally, a compact orientable surface of genus $g$) to be the sphere with $g$ handles attached (or equivalently, the sphere with $g$ holes).
\end{defn}

Do we have an Euler-type theorem in this setting? Different cycles on the torus give different values for $V-E+F$, we get all of 2, 1, 0. *picture*

\begin{prop}
    Let $G$ be a graph drawn on a surface of genus $g$ with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, and $f$ faces. Then $$n-m+f \ge 2 - 2g.$$
\end{prop}
\textbf{Remarks.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $E = 2 - 2g$ is the \textbf{Euler characteristic} of the surface of genus $g$.
    \item This is the direction of Euler's theorem ($\ge $, not $\le$) that we need to bound the number of edges of $G$.
    \item We do not assume that the graph is connected here.
    \item The proof is easy: we induct on $e(G)$. Removing an edge reduces $m$ by 1, and reduces $f$ by either 0 or 1.
\end{itemize} 
\begin{cor}
    Let $G$ be a graph with $|G|\ge 3$, drawn on a surface of Euler characteristic $E$. Then $$e(G)\le 3(|G|-E).$$
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
    If $e(G)\le 2$, we can check the claim holds. When $e(G) \ge 3$, then every face in $G$ has length at least 3, so
    \begin{align*}
        3f \le \sum_{F \text{ a face}}^{} \text{deg}(F) \le 2e(G).
    \end{align*}
    Thus $f \le \frac{2}{3}e(G)$, so $e(G) \le n + f - E \implies e(G) \le 3(n-E)$.
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}[Heawood's theorem]
    Let $G$ be a graph drawn on a surface of Euler characteristic $E \le 0$. Then
    \[
    \chi(G) \le \left\lfloor \frac{7+\sqrt{49-24E}}{2} \right\rfloor.
    \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let $G$ be a graph drawn on a surface of Euler characteristic $E$ and let $k = \chi(G)$. We may assume that $G$ is minimal, i.e. all proper subgraphs of $G$ have $\chi \le k-1$.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    We esimate $\delta(G)$ in two ways. Note $\delta(G)\ge k-1$: if not, let $x$ be a vertex with $\text{deg}(x)\le k-2$. We have $\chi(G-x)\le k-1$ by minimality, so we can put $x$ back and color it $\implies \chi(G)\le k-1$, contradiction.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    Note 
    \begin{align*}
        \delta(G)\le \text{the average degree of the graph} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{x \in V(G)}^{} \text{deg}(x) = \\
        \frac{2e(G)}{n} \le \frac{6(n-E)}{n} = 6 - \frac{6E}{n} \le 6 - \frac{6E}{k}
    \end{align*}
    because $n\ge k$ and $E \le 0$. So 
    \begin{align*}
        k-1 \le 6 - \frac{6E}{k} \implies k^2 - 7k + 6E \le 0 \implies k \le \frac{7 + \sqrt{49-24E}}{2}.
    \end{align*}
    As $k$ is an integer, we're done.
\end{proof}
\textbf{Remarks.} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Define $H(E) = \left\lfloor \frac{7+\sqrt{49-24E}}{2} \right\rfloor$.
    \item Did we just prove the four color theorem, since the above gives $H(2)=4$? No, since we assumed $E\le 0$.
    \item Amazingly, Heawood's theorem is sharp. In particular, $K_{H(E)}$ can be drawn in the surface of Euler characteristic $E$ (but this is very hard!).
\end{itemize}

\section{Extremal graph theory}

\textbf{Question.} What is the minimum number of edges a graph must have before it is forced to have a triangle? In other words, what is the value of $k$ such that if $e(G) > k$, then $K_3 \subset G$?
\vspace{1mm}

\textbf{Question.} How large does $\delta(G)$ have to be before $G$ is forced to have a cycle of length $|G|$?

\marginpar{02 Nov 2022, Lecture 12}

\begin{defn}
    A graph is said to be \textbf{Hamiltonian} if it contains a cycle that contains all vertices. Such a cycle is called a \textbf{Hamilton} cycle.
\end{defn}
\begin{theorem}[Dirac]
    Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices, $n \ge 3$. If $\delta(G)\ge \frac{n}{2}$, then $G$ is Hamiltonian.
\end{theorem}
\textbf{Remark.} This theorem is sharp. If $n$ is even, take two disjoint $K_{n/2}$'s. If $n$ is odd, take two copies of $K_{(n+1)/2}$ that overlap at exactly one vertex.

\begin{proof}
    First note that $G$ is connected. If $x \not\sim y$, then $N(x), N(y) \subset G-x-y$, but $|N(x)|,|N(y)|\ge \frac{n}{2}$, so $N(x) \cap N(y) \neq \emptyset$ by the pigeonhole principle, so $x$ and $y$ have a common neighbor.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    Now take a path of maximal length $x_1\ldots x_l$. The claim is that there is no cycle in $G$ of length $l$. Indeed, if such a cycle did exist, then either $l=n$ and we're done, or $l<n$ and we can use this cycle to find a path of length $l+1$ in $G$, contradicting maximality.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    Observe that $N(x_1) \subset \{x_2,\ldots,x_{l-1}\}$ and $N(x_l) \subset \{x_2,\ldots,x_{l-1}\}$. Now define $N^-(x_1) = \{x_i \mid x_{i+1} \in N(x_1)\}$. Note $$|N^-(X_1) \cup N^-(x_l)| \le \{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{l-1}\}\le l-1\le n-1,$$ 
    but $|N^-(x_1)|,|N(x_2)| \ge \frac{n}{2}$. So there must exist $x_i$ in their intersection.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    So we have $x_1 \ldots x_{i} x_l x_{l-1} \ldots x_{i+1} x_1$, a cycle of length $l$, a contradiction and we're done.
\end{proof}
\textbf{Remark.} Note that there's no interesting theorem of the form ''if $e(G) > K$, then $G$ is Hamiltonian'', since $K_{n-1} + x$ where $x$ has degree 1 is not Hamiltonian.

\begin{theorem}\label{4.2}
    Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices. Then $e(G) > \frac{n(k-1)}{2} \implies G$ contains a path of length $k$.
\end{theorem}
\textbf{Remark.} If $k \mid n$, then this is sharp: take the disjoint union of $\frac{n}{k}$ copies of $K_k$.
\begin{lemma}\label{4.3}
    Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices, $n\ge 3$, and let $k<n$. If $G$ is connected and $\delta(G) \ge \frac{k}{2}$, then $G$ contains a path of length $k$.
\end{lemma}
\textbf{Remarks.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We need the assumption that $k<n$, otherwise take $K_k$.
    \item We need the assumption that $G$ is connected, otherwise take a bunch of disjoint $K_k$.
    \item The $\frac{k}{2}$ is sharp. Take a bunch of $K_k$'s that overlap at a single vertex.
\end{itemize}
\begin{proof}
    Let $x_1\ldots x_l$ be a path of maximum length. We have that there is no cycle of length $l$: If $l=n$, then we're done since $k<n$, and if $l<n$, then use a cycle of length $l$ to build a path of length $l+1$ (since $G$ is connected), a contradiction.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    So we get $N(x_1) \subset \{x_2,\ldots,x_{l-1}\}, N(x_l) \subset \{x_2,\ldots,x_{l-1}\}$, and $N^-(x_1) = \{x_i \mid x_{i+1} \in N(x_1)\} \subset \{x_1,\ldots,x_{l-2}\}$. Thus
    \[
    |N^-(x_1) \cup N(x_l)| \le |\{x_1,\ldots,x_{l-1}\}| \le l-1 \stackrel{(\star)}{\le} k-1 
    \]
    (where $(\star)$ follows since else we're immediately done), but $|N^-(x_1)|, |N(x_l)| \ge \frac{k}{2}$, so $N^-(x_1) \cap N(x_l) \neq \emptyset$. So as before, we can build a cycle of length $l$, contradiction, done. 
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{4.2}]
    If $k=1$, we're done. Now assume $k\ge 2$ and apply induction on $n$, $n=2$ being clear.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    For the induction step, given a graph $G$ on $n\ge 3$ vertices, first note that $\frac{n(k-1)}{2} < e(G) \le \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \implies k \le n$. 
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    We may assume that $G$ is connected: say $C_1,\ldots,C_r$ are the components of $G$ and $|C_i|=n_i$. Then $\sum_{i=1}^{r} e(G[C_i]) = e(G) > \frac{n(k-1)}{2}$, so since $\sum_{i=1}^{r} n_i = n$, \[
    \sum_{i=1}^{r} \left(e(G[C_i]) - \frac{n_i(k-1)}{2}\right) > 0.
    \]
    So there exists some component $C_i$ that has $e(G[C_i]) > \frac{n_i(k-1)}{2}$, so apply induction to this component and we're done.
    \vspace{1mm}
    
    If $\delta(G)\ge \frac{k}{2}$, then apply Lemma \ref{4.3} to see that $G$ contains a path of length $k$. Otherwise, there exists a vertex $x \in V(G)$ with $\text{deg}(x) \le \frac{k-1}{2}$. Note that we have $$e(G-x) > \frac{n(k-1)}{2} - \frac{k-1}{2} = \frac{(n-1)(k-1)}{2},$$ hence $G$ contains a path of length $k$ and we're done.
\end{proof}
